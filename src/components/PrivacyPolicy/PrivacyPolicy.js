                <h2>Bubble Privacy Policy</h2>
                <h4>Effective September 5, 2020. Last Revised September 5, 2020</h4>
                <p>We want you to understand how and why The Bubble collects, uses and shares information about you when you use our services.  This privacy policy applies to all of our services.</p>
                <h4>What We Collect</h4>
                <p>We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:</p>
                <p>Account information.  To create an account, you must provide a username, email, and password.  Your username is public, and it does not have to be related to your real name. We also store your user account preferences and settings.</p>
                <p>Content you submit.  We collect the content you submit to the Services.  This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, your messages with other users (e.g.. Private messages, and chats), and your reports and other communications with moderators and us.  Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.</p>
                <p>Actions you take.  We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.  This includes your interactions with content, like liking, hiding, blocking, and reporting.  It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending and blocking.  We collect your interactions with groups, and privilege status in those groups.</p>
                <p>Other information.  You may choose to provide other information directly to us.  For example we may collect information when you fill out a form.</p>
                <h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
                <p>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:</p>
                <p>Log and usage data.  We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your ip address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, The Bubble Network will delete any ip addresses collected after 30 days.</p>
                <p>Information collected from cookies and similar technologies.  We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies.  We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content, and advertisements, and improve the quality of our services.</p>
                <p>Location information.  We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device.  We may also receive information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your ip address.</p>
                <h4>Information Collected from Other Sources</h4>
                <p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you.  For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile device ID. </p>
                <h4>How We Use Information About You</h4>
                <p>We use information about you to:</p>
                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve services;</li>
                <li>Research and develop new services;</li>
                <li>Help protect the safety of Bubble and our users, which include blocking spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Bubble user agreement and our other policies;</li>
                <li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and other support and administrative messages;</li>
                <li>Provide customer service</li>
                <li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other new information we think will be of interest to you.</li>
                <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services; and</li>
                <li>Personalize the services and provide advertisements, content and features that match user profiles or interests.</li>
                <h4>How Information About You Is Shared</h4>
                <p>When you use the Services. Certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example: </p>
                <li>When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the services, any users of our services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Although some parts of the Services may be private, they may become public, and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.
</li>
                <li>When you send private messages, or messages via groups, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a private chat after you send a message.
</li>
                <li>When others view your profile they will be able to see information such as your profile picture, recent posts, people who follow you, and your bio. (If you choose to make your account private, only people you allow to follow you can see your posts, and others who follow you).
</li>
                <li>We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media.  Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with a third party that provides the social sharing feature.  For information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features.
</li>
                <p>Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the services may still be viewable or available on our servers. 
                </p>
                <h4>Ads and Analytics Partners</h4>
                <p>We may partner with third party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services.  These parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device.</p>
                <h4>Advertisers and Ad Networks</h4>
                <p>Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Bubble does not link to or provide them with your actual Bubble account details. This means that Bubble does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Bubble cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Bubble cookies.</p>
                <h4>Analytics Partners</h4>
                <p>We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.</p>
                <h4>Deleting Your Account</h4>
                <p>You may delete your account information at any time from the user settings page.  When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.</p>
                <h4>Controlling the Use of Cookies</h4>
                <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p>
                <h4>Controlling Advertising and Analytics</h4>
                <p>Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here.</p>
                <p>We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences here. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices.</p>
                <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
                <p>Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.</p>
                <h4>Controlling Location Information</h4>
                <p>If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.</p>
                <h2>Other Information</h2>
                <h4>Information Security</h4>
                <p>We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.</p>
                <h4>Data Retention</h4>
                <p>We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>
                <h4>Additional Information for EEA Users</h4>
                <p>Users in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised using the information provided under “Your Choices” above or as described in the “Other Information - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests” section below. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory authority.

                As required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in the EEA only where we have legal bases for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. We process your information on the following legal bases:
                </p>
                <li>You have consented for us to do so for a specific purpose;</li>
                <li>We need to process the information to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>
                <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, enforcing our rules and policies, protecting our legal rights and interests, research and development, and marketing and promoting the Services;</li>
                <li>We need to process your information to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
                <h4>Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests</h4>
                <p>Requests for a copy of the information Bubble has about your account—including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) consumer information requests—can be submitted following the process described here.</p>
                <p>Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Bubble account or to a verified email address associated with your Bubble account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Bubble does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.</p>
                <h4>Children</h4>
                <p>Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the EEA, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have obtained verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.</p>
                <h4>Changes to This Policy</h4>
                <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the policy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will provide you with additional notice (such as sending out emails regarding updates). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. By continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.
